    <h2>ENGLISH HOMOPHONES</h2>

    <p class="side">Definition of homophone.</p>

    <p>When two or more words different in origin and signification
    are pronounced alike, whether they are alike or not in their
    spelling, they are said to be homophonous, or homophones of
    each other. Such words if spoken without context are of
    ambiguous signification. Homophone is strictly a relative term,
    but it is convenient to use it absolutely, and to call any word
    of this kind a homophone.<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

    <p>Homophony is between words as <i>significant</i> sounds, but
    it is needful to state that homophonous words must be
    <i>different</i> words, else we should include a whole class of
    words which are not true homophones. Such words as
    <i>draft</i>, <i>train</i>, <i>board</i>, have each of them
    separate meanings as various and distinct as some true
    homophones; for instance, a draught of air, the miraculous
    draught of fishes, the draught of a ship, the draft of a
    picture, or a draught of medicine, or the present draft of this
    essay, though it may ultimately appear medicinal, are, some of
    them, quite as distinct objects or notions as, for instance,
    <i>vane</i> and <i>vein</i> are: but the ambiguity of
    <i>draft</i>, however spelt, is due to its being the name of
    anything that is <i>drawn</i>; and since there are many ways of
    drawing things, and different things are drawn in different
    ways, the <i>same word</i> has come to carry very discrepant
    significations.</p>

    <p>Though such words as these<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
       are often inconveniently and even distressingly ambiguous,
       they are not homophones,
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"
       id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span> and are therefore excluded from
       my list: they exhibit different meanings of one word, not
       the same sound of different words: they are of necessity
       present, I suppose, in all languages, and corresponding
       words in independent languages will often develop exactly
       corresponding varieties of meaning. But since the ultimate
       origin and derivation of a word is sometimes uncertain, the
       scientific distinction cannot be strictly enforced.</p>

    <p class="side">False homophones.</p>

    <p>Now, wherever the same derivation of any two same-sounding
    words is at all doubtful, such words are practically
    homophones:—and again in cases where the derivation is
    certainly the same, yet, if the ultimate meanings have so
    diverged that we cannot easily resolve them into one idea, as
    we always can <i>draft</i>, these also may be practically
    reckoned as homophones.</p>

    <p><i>Continent</i>, adjective and substantive, is an example
    of absolute divergence of meaning, inherited from the Latin;
    but as they are different parts of speech, I allow their plea
    of identical derivation and exclude them from my list. On the
    other hand, the substantive <i>beam</i> is an example of such a
    false homophone as I include. <i>Beam</i> may signify a balk of
    timber, or a ray of light. Milton's address to light begins</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>O first created beam</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and Chaucer has</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>As thikke as motes in the sonne-beam,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and this is the commonest use of the word in poetry, and
    probably in literature: Shelley has</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Then the bright child the plumèd seraph came</p>

            <p>And fixed its blue and beaming eyes on mine.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But in Tyndal's gospel we read</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Why seest thou a mote in thy brother's eye and
            perceivest not</p>

            <p>the beam that is in thine own eye?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The word beam is especially awkward
    here,<a id="footnotetag3"
       name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
       because the beam that is proper to the eye is not the kind
       of beam which is intended. The absurdity is not excused by
       our familiarity, which Shakespeare submitted to, though he
       omits the incriminating eye:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>You found his mote; the king your mote did see,</p>

            <p>But I a beam do find in each of three.</p>
        </div>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"
       id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span> 

    <p>And yet just before he had written</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not</p>

            <p>To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,</p>

            <p>As thy eye-beams when their fresh rays have
            smote</p>

            <p>The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Let alone the complication that <i>mote</i> is also a
    homophone, and that outside Gulliver's travels one might as
    little expect to find a house-beam as a castle-moat in a man's
    eye, the confusion of <i>beam</i> is indefensible, and the
    example will serve three purposes: first to show how different
    significations of the same word may make practical homophones,
    secondly the radical mischief of all homophones, and thirdly
    our insensibility towards an absurdity which is familiar: but
    the absurdity is no less where we are accustomed to it than
    where it is unfamiliar and shocks us.</p>

    <p class="side">Tolerance due to habit.</p>

    <p>And we are so accustomed to homophones in English that they
    do not much offend us; we do not imagine their non-existence,
    and most people are probably unaware of their inconvenience. It
    might seem that to be perpetually burdened by an inconvenience
    must be the surest way of realizing it, but through habituation
    our practice is no doubt full of unconscious devices for
    avoiding these ambiguities: moreover, inconveniences to which
    we are born are very lightly taken: many persons have grown up
    to manhood blind of one eye without being aware of their
    disability; and others who have no sense of smell or who cannot
    hear high sounds do not miss the sense that they lack; and so I
    think it may be with us and our homophones.</p>

    <p>But since if all words were alike in sound there would be no
    spoken language, the differentiation of the sound of words is
    of the essence of speech, and it follows that the more
    homophones there are in any language, the more faulty is that
    language as a scientific and convenient vehicle of speech. This
    will be illustrated in due course: the actual condition of
    English with respect to homophones must be understood and
    appreciated before the nature of their growth and the possible
    means of their mitigation will seem practical questions.</p>

    <p class="side">Great number.</p>

    <p>The first essential, then, is to know the extent and nature
    of the mischief; and this can only be accomplished by setting
    out the homophones in a table before the eye. The list below is
    taken from a 'pronouncing dictionary' which professes not to
    deal with obsolete words, and it gives over
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"
       id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span> 800 ambiguous sounds; so that,
       since these must be at least doublets, and many of them are
       triplets or quadruplets, we must have something between
       1,600 and 2,000 words of ambiguous meaning in our ordinary
       vocabulary.<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

    <p>Now it is variously estimated that 3,000 to 5,000 words is
    about the limit of an average educated man's talking
    vocabulary, and since the 1,600 are, the most of them, words
    which such a speaker will use (the reader can judge for
    himself) it follows that he has a foolishly imperfect and
    clumsy instrument.</p>

    <p>As to what proportion 1,700 (say) may be to the full
    vocabulary of the language—it is difficult to estimate this
    because the dictionaries vary so much. The word
    <i>homophone</i> is not recognized by Johnson or by Richardson:
    Johnson under <i>homo-</i> has six derivatives of Herbert
    Spencer's favourite word <i>homogeneous</i>, but beside these
    only four other words with this Greek affix. Richardson's
    dictionary has an even smaller number of such entries. Jones
    has 11 entries of <i>homo-</i>, and these of only five words,
    but the Oxford dictionary, besides 50 words noted and quoted
    beginning with <i>homo-</i>, has 64 others with special
    articles.</p>

    <p>Dr. Richard Morris estimated the number of words in an
    English dictionary as 100,000: Jones has 38,000 words,
    exclusive of proper names, and I am told that the Oxford
    dictionary will have over 300,000. Its 114 <i>homo-</i> words
    will show how this huge number is partly supplied.</p>

    <p>Before the reader plunges into the list, I should wish to
    fortify his spirit against premature despair by telling him
    that in my tedious searching of the dictionary for these words
    I was myself cheered to find how many words there were which
    are <i>not</i>
    homophones.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"
       id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span> 

    <h2>LIST OF HOMOPHONES</h2>

    <p>This list, the object of which is to make the reader easily
    acquainted with the actual defect of the language in this
    particular, does not pretend to be complete or scientific; and
    in the identification of doubtful words the clue was dictated
    by brevity. <i>s.</i>, <i>v.</i>, and <i>adj.</i> mean
    <i>substantive</i>, <i>verb</i>, and <i>adjective</i>. The
    sections were made to aid the conspectus.</p>

    <p>The main indictment is contained in sections i, ii, and iii.
    These three sections contain 505 entries, involving some 1,075
    words.</p>

    <p>The homophones in the other sections, iv, v, vi, vii, viii
    and ix, are <i>generally</i> of such a kind that they would not
    of themselves constitute a very peculiar case against the
    English language; but their addition to the main list does very
    much strengthen the case. One intention in isolating them from
    the main list was to prevent their contaminating it with their
    weaker quality; but their separate classification crosses and
    sometimes overrides that more general distinction. Section iv
    has some literary interest; vi is inconsistent; the other
    sections are more or less scientific. These six sections
    contain some 330 entries involving about 700 words, so that the
    total of words involved is about 1,775.</p>

    <p>The order in this section is that of the phonetic
    alphabet.</p>

    <p>The facts of the case being now sufficiently supplied by the
    above list, I will put my attitude towards those facts in a
    logical sequence under separate statements, which thus isolated
    will, if examined one by one, avoid the confusion that their
    interdependence might otherwise occasion. The sequence is
    thus:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>1. Homophones are a nuisance.</p>

        <p>2. They are exceptionally frequent in English.</p>

        <p>3. They are self-destructive, and tend to become
        obsolete.</p>

        <p>4. This loss impoverishes the language.</p>

        <p>5. This impoverishment is now proceeding owing to the
        prevalence of the Southern English standard of speech.</p>

        <p>6. The mischief is being worsened and propagated by the
        phoneticians.</p>

        <p>7. The Southern English dialect has no claim to
        exclusive preference.</p>
    </blockquote><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
       id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span> 

    <h4>1. <i>That homophones are a nuisance.</i></h4>

    <p>An objector who should plead that homophones are not a
    nuisance might allege the longevity of the Chinese language,
    composed, I believe, chiefly of homophones distinguished from
    each other by an accentuation which must be delicate difficult
    and precarious. I remember that Max Müller [1864] instanced a
    fictitious sentence</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>ba bà bâ bá,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>'which (he wrote) is said to mean if properly accented
    <i>The three ladies gave a box on the ear to the favourite of
    the princess.</i>' This suggests that the bleating of sheep may
    have a richer significance than we are accustomed to suppose;
    and it may perhaps illustrate the origin as well as the decay
    of human speech. The only question that it raises for us is the
    possibility of distinguishing our own homophones by
    accentuation or by slight differentiation of vowels; and this
    may prove to be in some cases the practical solution, but it is
    not now the point in discussion, for no one will deny that such
    delicate distinctions are both inconvenient and dangerous, and
    should only be adopted if forced upon us. I shall assume that
    common sense and universal experience exonerate me from wasting
    words on the proof that homophones are mischievous, and I will
    give my one example in a note<a id="footnotetag8"
       name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>;
       but it is a fit place for some general remarks.</p>

    <p>The objections to homophones are of two kinds, either
    scientific and utilitarian, or æsthetic. The utilitarian
    objections <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"
       id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span> are manifest, and since
       confusion of words is not confined to homophones, the
       practical inconvenience that is sometimes occasioned by
       slight similarities may properly be alleged to illustrate
       and enforce the argument. I will give only one example.</p>

    <p class="side">Utilitarian objections not confined to
    homophones.</p>

    <p>The telephone, which seems to lower the value of
    differentiating consonants, has revealed unsuspected
    likenesses. For instance the ciphers, if written somewhat
    phonetically as usually pronounced, are thus:</p>

    <table summary="numbers"
           align="center">
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>

            <td>1</td>

            <td>2</td>

            <td>3</td>

            <td>4</td>

            <td>5</td>

            <td>6</td>

            <td>7</td>

            <td>8</td>

            <td>9</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>nawt</td>

            <td>wun</td>

            <td>too</td>

            <td>three</td>

            <td>fawr</td>

            <td>faiv</td>

            <td>six</td>

            <td>sev'n</td>

            <td>eit</td>

            <td>nain</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>by which it will be seen that the ten names contain eight
    but only eight different vowels, 0 and 4 having the same vowel
    <i>aw</i>, while 5 and 9 have <i>ai</i>. Both these pairs
    caused confusion; the first of them was cured by substituting
    the name of the letter O for the name of the zero cipher, which
    happens to be identical with it in form,<a id="footnotetag9"
       name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>
       and this introduced a ninth vowel sound <i>ou</i> (= owe),
       but the other pair remained such a constant source of error,
       that persons who had their house put on the general
       telephonic system would request the Post Office to give them
       a number that did not contain a 9 or a 5; and it is pretty
       certain that had not the system of automatic dialling, which
       was invented for quite another purpose, got rid of the
       trouble, one of these two ciphers would have changed its
       name at the Post Office.</p>

    <p class="side">Æsthetic objections.</p>

    <p>In the effect of uniformity it may be said that utilitarian
    and æsthetic considerations are generally at one; and this
    blank statement must here suffice, for the principle could not
    be briefly dealt with: but it follows from it that the proper
    æsthetic objections to homophones are never clearly separable
    from the scientific. I submit the following considerations. Any
    one who seriously attempts to write well-sounding English will
    be aware how delicately sensitive our ear is to the repetition
    of sounds. He will often have found it necessary to change some
    unimportant word because its accented vowel recalled and jarred
    with another which was perhaps as far as two or three lines
    removed from it: nor does there seem to be any rule for this,
    since apparently similar repetitions do not always offend, and
    may even be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
       id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span> agreeable. The relation of
       the sound to the meaning is indefinable, but in homophones
       it is blatant; for instance the common expression <i>It is
       well</i> could not be used in a paragraph where the word
       well (= well-spring) had occurred. Now, this being so, it is
       very inconvenient to find the omnipresent words <i>no</i>
       and <i>know</i> excluding each other: and the same is true
       of <i>sea</i> and <i>see</i>; if you are writing of the
       <i>sea</i> then the verb <i>to see</i> is forbidden, or at
       least needs some handling.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I see the deep's untrampled floor</p>

            <p>With green and purple seaweeds strewn:</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>here <i>seaweeds</i> is risky, but <i>I see the sea's
    untrampled floor</i> would have been impossible: even the
    familiar</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The sea saw that and fled</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>is almost comical, especially because 'sea saw' has a most
    compromising joint-tenant in the children's rocking game</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>See saw Margery daw.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The awkwardness of these English homophones is much
    increased by the absence of inflection, and I suppose it was
    the richness of their inflections which made the Greeks so
    indifferent (apparently) to syllabic recurrences that displease
    us: moreover, the likeness in sound between their similar
    syllables was much obscured by a verbal accent which respected
    the inflection and disregarded the stem, whereas our accent is
    generally faithful to the root.<a id="footnotetag10"
       name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>
       This sensitiveness <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
       id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span> to the sound of syllables is
       of the essence of our best English, and where the effect is
       most magical in our great poets it is impossible to
       analyse.</p>

    <p>Once become sensible of such beauty, and of the force of
    sounds, a writer will find himself in trouble with <i>no</i>
    and <i>know</i>. These omnipresent words are each of them
    essentially weakened by the existence of the other, while their
    proximity in a sentence is now damaging. It is a misfortune
    that our Southern dialect should have parted entirely with all
    the original differentiation between them; for after the
    distinctive <i>k</i> of the verb was dropped, the negative
    still preserved (as it in some dialects still preserves) its
    broad open vowel, more like <i>law</i> than <i>toe</i> or
    <i>beau</i>, and unless that be restored I should judge that
    the verb <i>to know</i> is doomed. The third person singular of
    its present tense is <i>nose</i>, and its past tense is
    <i>new</i>, and the whole inconvenience is too radical and
    perpetual to be received all over the world. We have an
    occasional escape by using <i>nay</i> for <i>no</i>, since its
    homophone <i>neigh</i> is an unlikely <i>neigh</i>bour; but
    that can serve only in one limited use of the word, and is no
    solution.</p>

    <p class="side">Punnage.</p>

    <p>In talking with friends the common plea that I have heard
    for homophones is their usefulness to the punster. 'Why! would
    you have no puns?' I will not answer that question; but there
    is no fear of our being insufficiently catered for; whatever
    accidental benefit be derivable from homophones, we shall
    always command it fully and in excess; look again at the
    portentous list of them! And since the essential jocularity of
    a pun (at least when it makes me laugh) lies in a humorous
    incongruity, its farcical gaiety may be heightened by a queer
    pronunciation. I cannot pretend to judge a sophisticated taste;
    but, to give an example, if, as I should urge, the <i>o</i> of
    the word <i>petrol</i> should be preserved, as it is now
    universally spoken, not having yet degraded into <i>petr'l</i>,
    a future squire will not be disqualified from airing his wit to
    his visitors by saying, as he points to his old stables, 'that
    is where I store my petrel', and when the joke had been
    illustrated in <i>Punch</i>, its folly would sufficiently
    distract the patients in a dentist's waiting-room for years to
    come, in spite of gentlemen and chauffeurs continuing to say
    <i>petrol</i>, as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
       id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span> they do now; nor would the
       two <i>petr'ls</i> be more dissimilar than the two
       <i>mys</i>.</p>

    <p class="side">Play on words.</p>

    <p>Puns must of course be distinguished from such a play on
    words as John of Gaunt makes with his own name in Shakespeare's
    <i>King Richard II</i>.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p><i>K.</i> What comfort man? How is't with aged
            Gaunt?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p><i>G.</i> O, how that name befits my
            composition!</p>

            <p class="i4">Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old,
            &amp;c.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>where, as he explains,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Misery makes sport to mock itself.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>This is a humorous indulgence of fancy, led on by the
    associations of a word; a pun is led off by the <i>sound</i> of
    a word in pursuit of nonsense; though the variety of its
    ingenuity may refuse so simple a definition.</p>

    <p class="side">An indirect advantage of homophones.</p>

    <p>It is true that a real good may sometimes come indirectly
    from a word being a homophone, because its inconvenience in
    common parlance may help to drive it into a corner where it can
    be retained for a special signification: and since the special
    significance of any word is its first merit, and the coinage of
    new words for special differentiation is difficult and rare, we
    may rightly welcome any fortuitous means for their provision.
    Examples of words specialized thus from homophones are
    <i>brief</i> (a lawyer's brief), <i>hose</i> (water-pipe),
    <i>bolt</i> (of door), <i>mail</i> (postal), <i>poll</i>
    (election), &amp;c.<a id="footnotetag11"
       name="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

    <h4>2. <i>That English is exceptionally burdened with
    homophones.</i></h4>

    <p>This is a reckless assertion; it may be that among the
    languages unknown to me there are some that are as much
    hampered with homophones as we are. I readily grant that with
    all our embarrassment of riches, we cannot compete with the
    Chinese nor pretend to have outbuilt their Babel; but I doubt
    whether the statement can be questioned if confined to European
    languages. I must rely on the evidence of my list, and I would
    here apologize for its incompleteness. After I had patiently
    extracted it from the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
       id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span> dictionary a good many common
       words that were missing occurred to me now and again, and
       though I have added these, there must be still many
       omissions. Nor must it be forgotten that, had obsolete words
       been included, the total would have been far higher. That
       must plainly be the case if, as I contend, homophony causes
       obsolescence, and reference to the list from Shakespeare in
       my next section will provide examples of such words.</p>

    <p>Otto Jespersen<a id="footnotetag12"
       name="footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>
       seems to think that the inconvenience of homophones is so
       great that a language will naturally evolve some phonetic
       habit to guard itself against them, although it would
       otherwise neglect such distinction. I wish that this
       admirable instinct were more evident in English. He writes
       thus of the lists of words which he gives 'to show what
       pairs of homonyms [homophones] would be created if
       distinctions were abolished that are now maintained: they
       [the lists] thus demonstrate the force of resistance opposed
       to some of the sound-changes which one might imagine as
       happening in the future. A language can tolerate only a
       certain number of ambiguities arising from words of the same
       sound having different significations, and therefore the
       extent to which a language has utilized some phonetic
       distinction to keep words apart, has some influence in
       determining the direction of its sound-changes. In French,
       and still more in English, it is easy to enumerate long
       lists of pairs of words differing from each other only by
       the presence or absence of voice in the last sound;
       therefore final <i>b</i> and <i>p</i>, <i>d</i> and
       <i>t</i>, <i>g</i> and <i>k</i>, are kept rigidly apart; in
       German, on the other hand, there are very few such pairs,
       and thus nothing counterbalances the natural tendency to
       unvoice final consonants.'</p>

    <p>3. <i>That homophones are self-destructive and tend to
    become obsolete.</i></p>

    <p>For the contrary contention, namely, that homophones do
    <i>not</i> destroy themselves, there is prima facie evidence in
    the long list of survivors, and in the fact that a vast number
    of words which have not this disadvantage are equally gone out
    of use.</p>

    <p class="side">Causes of obsolescence.</p>

    <p>Words fall out of use for other reasons than homophony,
    therefore one cannot in any one case assume that ambiguity
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span> of meaning was the active
       cause: indeed the mere familiarity of the sound might
       prolong a word's life; and homophones are themselves
       frequently made just in this way, for uneducated speakers
       will more readily adapt a familiar sound to a new meaning
       (as when my gardener called his Pomeranian dog a Panorama)
       than take the trouble to observe and preserve the
       differentiation of a new sound. There is no rule except that
       any loss of distinction may be a first step towards total
       loss.<a id="footnotetag13"
       name="footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

    <p>It is probable that the working machinery of an average
    man's brain sets a practical limit to his convenient workable
    vocabulary; that is to say, a man who can easily command the
    spontaneous use of a certain number of words cannot much
    increase it without effort. If that is so, then, as he learns
    new words, there will be a tendency, if not a necessity, for
    him to lose hold of a corresponding number of his old words;
    and the words that will first drop out will be those with which
    he had hitherto been uncomfortable; and among those words will
    be the words of ambiguous meaning.</p>

    <p class="side">No direct proof</p>

    <p>It is plain that only general considerations can be of
    value, unless there should be very special evidence in any
    special case; and thus the caution of Dr. Henry Bradley's
    remarks in note on page <a href="#page19">19</a>.</p>

    <p>I remember how I first came to recognize this law; it was
    from hearing a friend advocating the freer use of certain old
    words which, though they were called obsolete and are now
    rarely heard, yet survive in local dialects. I was surprised to
    find how many of them were unfit for resuscitation because of
    their homophonic ambiguity, and when I spoke of my discovery to
    a philological friend, I found that he regarded it as a
    familiar and unquestioned rule.</p>

    <p>But to prove this rule is difficult; and as it is an
    impossible task to collect all the obsolete words and classify
    them, I am proposing to take two independent indications; first
    to separate out the homophones from the other obsolete words in
    a Shakespearian glossary, and secondly, to put together
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"
       id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span> a few words that seem to be
       actually going out of use in the present day, that is,
       strictly obsolescent words caught in the act of
       flitting.</p>

    <p class="side">Obsolescence defined.</p>

    <p>Obsolescence in this connexion must be understood only of
    common educated speech, that is, the average speaker's
    vocabulary. Obsolescent words are old words which, when heard
    in talk, will sound literary or unusual: in literature they can
    seem at home, and will often give freshness without
    affectation; indeed, any word that has an honourable place in
    Shakespeare or the Bible can never quite die, and may perhaps
    some day recover its old vitality.</p>

    <p class="side">Evidence of obsolescence.</p>

    <p>The best evidence of the obsolescence of any word is that it
    should still be frequently heard in some proverb or phrase, but
    never out of it. The homophonic condition is like that of
    <i>aural</i> and <i>oral</i>, of which it is impossible to make
    practical use.<a id="footnotetag14"
       name="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>
       We speak of an <i>aural surgeon</i> and of <i>oral
       teaching</i>, but out of such combinations the words have no
       sense. It happens that oral teaching must be aural on the
       pupil's side, but that only adds to the confusion.</p>

    <p>In deciding whether any obsolete homophone has been lost by
    its homophony, I should make much of the consideration whether
    the word had supplied a real need, by naming a conception that
    no other word so fitly represented; hence its survival in a
    proverb is of special value, because the words of proverbs are
    both apt and popular; so that for the disuse of such a word
    there would seem to be no other cause so likely and sufficient
    as damage to its signification.</p>

    <p>The glossary is relied on to contain, besides its other
    items, all the obsolete words: the homophones separated out
    from these will show various grades of obsolescence, and very
    different values as examples bearing on the question at
    issue.</p>

    <p><i>Table of homophones taken from among the obsolete words
    in Cunliffe's 'A New Shakespearean Dictionary,' Blackie</i>,
    1910.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><b>ancient</b>: replaced by ensign.</p>

        <p><b>bate</b> = remit.</p>

        <p><b>beck</b> = a bow of the head: preserved in 'becks and
        nods', mutual loss with beck = rivulet.</p>

        <p><b>boot</b> = to profit: Sh. puns on it, showing that
        its absurdity was recognized.</p>

        <p><b>bottle</b> (of hay): preserved in proverb.</p>

        <p><b>bourne</b> = streamlet: preserved
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
           id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span> in sense of limit by the
           line of Sh. which perhaps destroyed it.</p>

        <p><b>breeze</b> = gadfly.</p>

        <p><b>brief</b> (<i>subs.</i>): now only as a lawyer's
        brief.</p>

        <p><b>brook</b> (<i>verb</i>).</p>

        <p><b>buck</b> = to steep (linen) in lye.</p>

        <p><b>cote</b>: as in sheepcote.</p>

        <p><b>dole</b> = portion, and dole = sorrow: probably
        active mutual destruction; we still retain 'to dole
        out'.</p>

        <p><b>dout</b>.</p>

        <p><b>dun</b> (<i>adj.</i>): now only in combination as
        dun-coloured.</p>

        <p><b>ear</b> = to plough.</p>

        <p><b>fain</b> and <b>feign</b>: prob. mutual loss due to
        undefined sense of <b>fain</b>. n.b. <b>fane</b> also
        obsolete.</p>

        <p><b>feat</b> (<i>adj.</i>) and <b>featly</b>: well

        <p><b>flaw</b>: now confined to a flaw in metal,
        &amp;c.</p>

        <p><b>fleet</b> (<i>verb</i>) and <b>fleeting</b>, as in
        the sun-dial motto, 'Time like this shade doth fleet and
        fade.'</p>

        <p><b>foil</b>: common verb, obsolete.</p>

        <p><b>gest</b>: lost in <i>jest</i>.</p>

        word.</p>

        <p><b>gout</b> = a drop of liquor.</p>

        <p><b>gust</b> = taste (well lost).</p>

        <p><b>hoar</b>: only kept in combination, hoar-frost, hoar
        hairs.</p>

        <p><b>hose</b>: lost, though hosier remains, but
        specialized in <i>garden-hose, &amp;c.</i></p>

        <p><b>hue</b>: not now used of colour.</p>

        <p><b>imbrued</b> (with blood): prob. lost in
        <i>brewed</i>.</p>

        &amp;c.</p>

        <p><b>marry!</b></p>

        <p><b>mated</b> = confused in mind (well lost).</p>

        <p><b>meed</b>: lost in <i>mead</i> = meadow (also obs.)
        <i>and mead=metheglin</i>.</p>

        <p><b>mete</b> and <b>metely</b> = fitting, also
        <b>mete</b> in 'mete it out', both lost in <i>meet</i> and
        <i>meat</i>.</p>

        <p><b>mere</b> (<i>subs.</i>).</p>

        <p><b>mouse</b> (<i>verb</i>): to bite and tear.</p>

        <p><b>mow</b> = a grimace.</p>

        <p><b>muse</b> = to wonder: lost in <i>amuse</i> and
        <i>Muse</i>.</p>

        <p><b>neat</b> = ox.</p>

        <p><b>ounce</b> = pard.</p>

        <p><b>peak</b>: survives only in 'peak and pine' and in
        <i>peaky</i>.</p>

        <p><b>pelting</b> = paltry, also <b>pelt</b> = a skin,
        lost.</p>

        <p><b>quean</b> = a woman.</p>

        <p><b>rack</b> (of clouds).</p>

        <p><b>raze</b> (to the ground). The meaning being the very
        opposite of <i>raise</i>, the word <i>raze</i> is
        intolerable.</p>

        <p><b>rede</b> = counsel, n.b. change of meaning.</p>

        <p><b>rheum</b>: survives in rheumatic, &amp;c.</p>

        <p><b>scald</b> = scurvy (<i>adj.</i>).</p>

        <p><b>sleave</b> = a skein of silk, 'The ravelled sleave of
        care', usually misinterpreted, the equivocal alternative
        making excellent sense.</p>

        <p><b>souse</b> <i>(verb):</i> of a bird of prey
        swooping.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"
           id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span> 

        <p><b>speed</b>: as in 'St. Francis be thy speed' = help,
        aid.</p>

        <p><b>stale</b> = bait or decoy (well lost).</p>

        <p><b>tarre</b>: to 'tarre a dog on' = incite.</p>

        <p><b>tickle</b> = unstable.</p>

        <p><b>tire</b> = to dress (the hair, &amp;c.).</p>

        <p><b>vail</b> = to let fall.</p>

        <p><b>wreak.</b></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Besides the above may be noted</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><b>wont</b> (<i>sub.</i>): lost in <i>won't</i> = will
        not.</p>

        <p><b>fair</b>: Though we still speak of 'a fair
        complexion' the word has lost much of its old use: and the
        verb <b>to fare</b> has suffered; we still say 'Farewell',
        but scarcely 'he fares ill'; also <b>to fare forth</b> is
        obsolete.</p>

        <p><b>bolt</b> = to sift, has gone out, also <b>bolt</b> in
        the sense of a missile weapon; but the weapon may have gone
        first; we still preserve it in 'a bolt from the blue', a
        thunder-bolt, and 'a fool's bolt is soon shot', and we
        shoot the bolt of a door.</p>

        <p><b>barm</b>: this being the name of an object which
        would be familiar only to brewers and bakers, probably
        suffered from the discontinuance of family brewing and
        baking. It would no longer be familiar, and may possibly
        have felt the blurring effect of the ill-defined
        <b>balm</b>, which word also seems rarely used. In the
        South of England few persons now know what barm is.</p>

        <p><b>arch</b>: <i>adj.</i>, probably obsolescent.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>There are also examples of words with the affix a-, or
    initials simulating that affix, thus:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><b>aby</b>: lost in <i>abide</i>, with which it was
        confused.</p>

        <p><b>abode</b> = bode (? whether ever in common use).</p>

        <p><b>accite</b>: lost in <i>excite</i>.</p>

        <p><b>assay</b>: quite a common word, lost in <i>say</i>
        (?)</p>

        <p><b>atone</b>: lost in <i>tone</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>and thus <i>attempt</i>, <i>attaint</i>, <i>attest</i>,
    <i>avail</i>, all suffered from <i>tempt</i>, <i>taint</i>,
    <i>test</i>, <i>veil</i>, whereas <i>attend</i> seems to have
    destroyed <i>tend</i>.</p>

    <h4>4. <i>That the loss due to homophony threatens to
    impoverish the language.</i></h4>

    <p>New words are being added to the dictionary much faster than
    old words are passing out of use, but it is not a question of
    numbers nor of dictionaries. A chemist told me that if the
    world were packed all over with bottles as close as they could
    stand, he could put a different substance into each one and
    label it. And science is active in all her laboratories and
    will print her labels. If one should admit that as many as
    ninety-nine per cent. of these artificial names are neither
    literary nor social words, yet some of them are, since
    everything that comes into common use must have a name that is
    frequently spoken. Thus <i>baik</i>, <i>sackereen</i>, and
    <i>mahjereen</i> are truly new English word-sounds; and it may
    be, if we succumb to anarchical communism, that margarine and
    saccharine will be lauded by its dissolute mumpers as
    enthusiastically as men have hitherto praised and are still
    praising butter and honey. 'Bike' certainly would have already
    won a decent place in poetry had it been
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"
       id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span> christened more gracefully
       and not nicknamed off to live in backyards with cab and bus.
       The whole subject of new terms is too vast to be
       parenthetically handled, and I hope that some one will deal
       with it competently in an early publication of the S.P.E.
       The question must here remain to be determined by the
       evidence of the words in the table of obsoletes, which I
       think is convincing; my overruling contention being that,
       however successful we may be in the coinage of new words
       (and we have no reason to boast of success) and however
       desirable it is to get rid of some of the bad useless
       homophones, yet we cannot afford to part with any old term
       that can conveniently be saved.</p>

    <p>We have the best Bible in the world, and in Shakespeare the
    greatest poet; we have been suckled on those twin breasts, and
    our children must have degenerated if they need asses' milk.
    Nor is it only because the old is better than the new that we
    think thus. If we speak more proudly of Trafalgar than of
    Zeebrugge, it is not because Trafalgar is so far finer a
    sounding word than Zeebrugge, as indeed it is, nor because we
    believe that the men of Nelson's time were better than our men
    of to-day, we know they were not, but because the spirit that
    lives on ideals will honour its parents; and it is thinking in
    this way that makes noble action instinctive and easy. Nelson
    was present at Zeebrugge leading our sailors, as Shakespeare is
    with us leading our writers, and no one who neglects the rich
    inheritance to which Englishmen are born is likely ever to do
    any credit to himself or his country.</p>

    <h4>5. <i>That the South English dialect is a direct and chief
    cause of homophones.</i></h4>

    <p class="side">Evidence of Jones' dictionary.</p>

    <p>Evidence of the present condition of our ruling educated
    speech in the South of England I shall take from Mr. Daniel
    Jones' dictionary,<a id="footnotetag16"
       name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>
       the authority of which cannot, I think, be disputed. It is
       true that it represents a pronunciation so bad that its
       slovenliness is likely to be thought overdone, but there is
       no more exaggeration than any economical
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"
       id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span> system of phonetic spelling
       is bound to show. It is indeed a strong and proper objection
       to all such simplifications that they are unable to exhibit
       the finer distinctions; but this must not imply that Mr.
       Jones' ear is lacking in delicate perception, or that he is
       an incompetent observer. If he says, as he does say, that
       the second syllable in the words <i>obloquy</i> and
       <i>parasite</i> are spoken by educated Londoners with the
       same vowel-sound (which he denotes by ə, that is the sound
       of <i>er</i> in the word <i>danger</i>), then it is true
       that they are so pronounced, or at least so similarly that a
       trained ear refuses to distinguish them [óbl<i>er</i>quy,

    <p>To this an objector might fairly reply that Mr. Jones could
    distinguish the two sounds very well if it suited him to do so;
    but that, as it is impossible for him to note them in his
    defective phonetic script, he prefers to confuse them. I shall
    not lose sight of this point,<a id="footnotetag17"
       name="footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>
       but here I will only say that, if there really is a
       difference between these two vowels in common talk, then if
       Mr. Jones can afford to disregard it it must be practically
       negligible, and other phoneticians will equally disregard
       it, as the Oxford Press has in its smaller dictionary.</p>

    <p class="side">Its trustworthiness.</p>

    <p>I suppose that thirty years ago it would have been almost
    impossible to find any German who could speak English so well
    as to pass for a native: they spoke as Du Maurier delighted to
    represent them in <i>Punch</i>. During the late war, however,
    it has been no uncommon thing for a German soldier to disguise
    himself in English uniform and enter our trenches, relying on
    his mastery of our tongue to escape suspicion; and it was
    generally observed how many German prisoners spoke English
    <i>like a native</i>. Now this was wholly due to their having
    been taught Southern English on Mr. Jones' model and
    method.</p>

    <p>Again, those who would repudiate the facts that I am about
    to reveal, and who will not believe that in their own careless
    talk they themselves actually pronounce the words very much as
    Mr. Jones prints them,<a id="footnotetag18"
       name="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>
       should remember <span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"
       id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span> that the sounds of speech are
       now mechanically recorded and reproduced, and the records
       can be compared; so that it would betray incompetence for
       any one in Mr. Jones' position to misrepresent the facts, as
       it would be folly in him to go to the trouble and expense of
       making such a bogus book as his would be were it untrue; nor
       could he have attained his expert reputation had he
       committed such a folly.</p>

    <p>Again, and in support of the trustworthiness of the records,
    I am told by those concerned in the business that for some
    years past no Englishman could obtain employment in Germany as
    teacher of English unless he spoke the English vowels according
    to the standard of Mr. Jones' dictionary; and it was a
    recognized device, when such an appointment was being
    considered, to request the applicant to speak into a machine
    and send the record by post to the Continent; whereupon he was
    approved or not on that head by the agreement of the record
    with the standard which I am about to illustrate from the
    dictionary.</p>

    <p>All these considerations make a strong case for the truth of
    Mr. Jones' representation of our 'standard English', and his
    book is the most trustworthy evidence at my disposal: but
    before exhibiting it I would premise that our present
    fashionable dialect is not to be considered as the wanton local
    creator of all the faults that Mr. Jones can parade before the
    eye. Its qualities have come together in various ways, nor are
    the leading characteristics of recent origin. I am convinced
    that our so-called standard English sprang actively to the fore
    in Shakespeare's time, that in the Commonwealth years our
    speech was in as perilous a condition as it is to-day, and at
    the Restoration made a self-conscious recovery, under an
    impulse very like that which is moving me at the present
    moment; for I do not look upon myself as expressing a personal
    conviction so much as interpreting a general feeling, shared I
    know by almost all who speak our tongue, Americans,
    Australians, Canadians, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"
       id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span> Irish, New Zealanders, and
       Scotch, whom I range alphabetically lest I should be thought
       to show prejudice or bias in any direction. But this is
       beyond the present purpose, which is merely to exhibit the
       tendency which this so-called degradation has to create
       homophones.</p>

    <p class="side">Mauling of words.</p>

    <p>As no one will deny that homophones are to be made by
    mauling words, I will begin by a selection of words from Mr.
    Jones' dictionary showing what our Southern English is doing
    with the language. I shall give in the first column the word
    with its literary spelling, in the second Mr. Jones' phonetic
    representation of it, and in the third column an attempt to
    represent that sound to the eye of those who cannot read the
    phonetic script, using such makeshift spellings as may be found
    in any novel where the pronunciation of the different speakers
    is differentiated.</p>

    <p>In culling these flowers of speech I was not blind to their
    great picturesque merits, but they must not be taken for jokes,
    at least they must not be thought of as conjuring smiles on the
    faces of Messrs. Jones, Michaelis and Rippmann: they are deadly
    products of honest study and method, and serious evidence
    whereby any one should be convinced that such a standard of
    English pronunciation is likely to create homophones: and yet
    in searching the dictionary I have not found it guilty of many
    new ones.<a id="footnotetag20"
       name="footnotetag20"></a><a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a>
       For examples of homophones due to our 'standard' speech one
       might take first the 20 <i>wh</i>- words (given on page
       <a href="#page14">14</a>) which have lost their aspirate,
       and with them the 9 <i>wr</i>- words: next the 36 words in
       table iv and note, which have lost their trilled <i>R</i>:
       and then the 41 words from table vi on page
       <a href="#page15">15</a>; and that would start us with some
       100 words, the confusion of which is due to our Southern
       English pronunciation, since the differentiation of all
       these words is still preserved in other dialects. The
       differentiation of these 100 words would of course liberate
       their twins, so the total number of gains should be
       doubled.</p>

    <p class="side">Example of one class.</p>

    <p>But number is not so important as the quality and frequency
    of the words involved, so I will instance one class in detail,
    namely the words in which <i>aw</i> and <i>or</i> are confused.
    Here are a dozen of them:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>core = caw.</p>

            <p>door = daw*.</p>

            <p>floor = flaw*.</p>

            <p>hoar* = haw.</p>

            <p>lore* = law.</p>

            <p>more = maw*.</p>

            <p>oar, ore = awe*.</p>

            <p>pore = paw.</p>

            <p>roar = raw.</p>

            <p>soar, sore = saw, saw.</p>

            <p>tore = taw.</p>

            <p>yore* = yaw.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Of these 12 words, 6 exhibit stages or symptoms of
    obsolescence. I should think it extremely unlikely that
    <i>yore</i> has been in any way incommoded by <i>yaw</i>; and
    <i>flaw</i>, which is now more or less cornered to one of its
    various meanings, was probably affected more by its own
    ambiguities than by <i>floor</i>; but others seem to be
    probable examples: <i>shaw</i> and <i>lore</i>, and I think
    <i>maw</i>, are truly obsoletes, while <i>hoar</i> and
    <i>daw</i> are heard only in combination. <i>Awe</i> is heard
    only in <i>awful</i>, and has there lost its significance. I
    should <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
       id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span> guess that this accident has
       strengthened its severity in literature, where it asserts
       its aloofness sometimes with a full spelling [<i>aweful</i>]
       as in speech two pronunciations are recognized, <i>awful</i>
       and <i>awf'l</i>.</p>

    <p>Now how do these words appear in Jones' dictionary? If there
    is to be any difference between the <i>aw</i> and <i>ore</i>
    sounds either the <i>R</i> must be trilled as it still is in
    the north, or some vestige of it must be indicated, and such
    indication would be a lengthening of the <i>o</i> (=<i>aw</i>)
    sound by the vestigial voicing of the lost trill, such as is
    indicated in the word <i>o'er</i>, and might be roughly shown
    to the eye by such a spelling as <i>shawer</i> for <i>shore</i>
    [thus <i>shaw</i> would be ʃɔ: and <i>shore</i> would be ʃɔ:ə]
    and such distinction is still made by our more careful Southern
    English speakers, and is recognized as an existent variant by
    Jones.</p>

    <p>Since the circumflex accent properly indicates a rise and
    fall of voice-pitch on a vowel-sound such as almost makes a
    disyllable of a monosyllable (e.g. in Milton's verse the word
    <i>power</i> may fill either one or two places in the line) I
    will adopt it here to denote this fuller and differentiating
    pronunciation of <i>ore</i>.</p>

    <p>Now to all these words, and to the finals of such words as
    <i>ad[ore]</i>, <i>impl[ore]</i>, <i>ign[ore]</i>, Jones gives
    the diphthongal <i>aw</i> as the normal South English
    pronunciation, and he allows the longer <i>[ore]</i> sound only
    as a variant, putting this variant in the second place.</p>

    <p>Hence, all these <i>[ore]</i> words are being encouraged to
    cast off the last remnant of their differentiation, which it is
    admitted that they have not yet quite
    lost.<a id="footnotetag21"

    <h4>6. <i>That the mischief is being propagated by
    phoneticians.</i></h4>

    <p class="side">The use of phonetics in education.</p>

    <p>The phoneticians are doing useful work in supplying an
    educational need. By the phonetic system any spoken language
    can now be learned quickly and easily, just as by the
    <i>sol-fa</i> system the teaching of music was made easy and
    simple. If a clergyman who had no practical knowledge of music
    were offered the post of minor canon in a cathedral, he would
    find it very difficult to qualify himself passably, whereas any
    village schoolboy could learn all the music necessary for such
    an office, and learn that solidly too and soundly and durably,
    in a few lessons, truly in a few hours, by the <i>sol-fa</i>
    method. The principle is the same in music and in speech,
    namely to have a distinct symbol for every separate sound; in
    music it is a name, the idea of which quickly becomes
    indissociable from the note of the scale which it indicates; in
    phonetics it is a written letter, which differs from the units
    of our literary alphabet only in this, that it has but one
    meaning and interpretation, and really is what all letters were
    originally intended to be. When you see it you know what it
    means.</p>

    <p class="side">Its general adoption certain.</p>

    <p>The principle is but common sense, and practice confirms its
    validity. I am persuaded that as soon as competition has
    exposed the advantages which it ensures, not only in the saving
    of time, but in the rescuing of English children from the
    blighting fog through which their tender minds are now forced
    to struggle on the first threshold of
    life,<a id="footnotetag22"
       name="footnotetag22"></a><a href="#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a>
       then all spoken languages will be taught on that method.
       What now chiefly hinders its immediate introduction is not
       so much the real difficulty of providing a good simple
       system, as the false fear that all our literature may take
       on the phonetic dress; and this imagination is frightful
       enough <span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"
       id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span> to be a bugbear to reasonable
       people, although, so far as one can see, there is no more
       danger of this result than there is of all music appearing
       in sol-fa notation.</p>

    <p class="side">Demand of the market.</p>

    <p>Now here is a promising field for adventure. Not only is the
    creation of a new fount of type an elaborate and expensive
    process, but the elaboration of a good system and its public
    recognition when produced involve much time; so that any
    industrial company that is early in the market with a complete
    apparatus and a sufficient reputation will carry all before it,
    and be in a position to command and secure great monetary
    profit.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt that the field is now strongly held by the
    Anglo-Prussian society which Mr. Jones
    represents.<a id="footnotetag23"
       name="footnotetag23"></a><a href="#footnote23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

    <p>In the preceding section Mr. Jones' dictionary was taken as
    authority for the actual condition of Southern English
    pronunciation. It must now be considered in its other aspect,
    namely as the authoritative phonetic interpretation of our
    speech; my contention being that it is a wrong and mischievous
    interpretation.</p>

    <p>It is difficult to keep these two questions quite apart.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"
       id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span> The first, which was dealt
       with in Section 5, was that Southern English is actively
       productive of homophones. This present Section 6 is
       contending that the mischief is being encouraged and
       propagated by the phoneticians, and Mr. Jones' books are
       taken as an example of their method.</p>

    <p class="side">Fault of Mr. Jones' method.</p>

    <p>The reason why the work of these phoneticians is so
    mischievous is that they have chosen too low a standard of
    pronunciation.</p>

    <p>The defence that they would make would be something like
    this.</p>

    <p>They might argue with some confidence, and not without a
    good show of reason, that the actual 'vernacular' talk of the
    people is the living language of any country: they would allege
    that a spoken language is always changing, and always will
    change; that the actual condition of it is the only scientific,
    and indeed the only possible basis for any system of tuition;
    and that it is better to be rather in advance of change than
    behind it, since the changes proceed inevitably by laws which
    education has no power to resist, nay, so inevitably that
    science can in some measure foresee the future.</p>

    <p>This would, I suppose, fairly represent Mr. Jones'
    contention. Indeed, he plainly asserts that his work is merely
    a record of existing facts, and he even says that he chose
    Southern English because it is most familiar and observable,
    and therefore capable of providing him with sufficient
    phenomena: and he might say that what I call 'low' in his
    standard is only the record of a stage of progression which I
    happen to dislike or have not nearly observed. And yet the
    argument is full of fallacies: and the very position that he
    assumes appears to me to be unsound. It is well enough to
    record a dialect, nor will any one grudge him credit for his
    observation and diligence, but to reduce a dialect to theoretic
    laws and then impose those laws upon the speakers of it is
    surely a monstrous step. And in this particular instance the
    matter is complicated by the fact that Southern English is not
    truly a natural dialect; Mr. Jones himself denotes it as
    P.S.P.=Public School Pronunciation, and that we know to be very
    largely a social convention dependent on fashion and education,
    and inasmuch as it is a product of fashion and education it is
    not bound by the theoretical laws which Mr. Jones would
    attribute to it; while for the same reason it is unfortunately
    susceptible of being affected by them, if they should be taught
    with authority. These <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
       id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span> phoneticians would abuse a
       false position which they have unwarrantably created. This
       Southern English, this P.S.P., is a 'fashionable' speech,
       fashionable that is in two senses; and Mr. Jones would
       fashion it.</p>

    <p class="side">judged by practical effects.</p>

    <p>But I wish to put my case practically, and, rather than
    argue, I would ask what are the results of learning English on
    Mr. Jones' system? What would be the condition of a man who had
    learnt in this way?</p>

    <p class="side">His three styles.</p>

    <p>I shall assume that the pupil has learnt his pronunciation
    from the dictionary, the nature of which is now known to my
    readers: but they should also know that Mr. Jones recognizes
    and teaches three different styles, which he calls the A, B,
    and C styles, 'A, the pronunciation suitable for recitation or
    reading in public; B, the pronunciation used in careful
    conversation, or reading aloud in private; and C, the
    pronunciation used in rapid conversation.'</p>

    <p>In a polemic against Mr. Jones his adversary has therefore
    to combat a dragon with three heads, and the heroic method
    would be to strike all three of them off at one blow. To effect
    this it seems to me that one has only to remark that a system
    which is forced to teach a dialect [a dialect, observe, not a
    language] in three forms where one is sufficient, is <i>ipso
    facto</i> condemned. This objection I will establish presently;
    at present I am content to confine my attention to one head,
    for I maintain that in practice those who will take the trouble
    to learn three forms of one speech must be a negligible number;
    the practical pupils will generally be content to master one,
    and that will, no doubt, be the highly recommended style B, and
    its corresponding dictionary; they will rule out A and C as
    works of supererogation; and indeed those would be needless if
    B were satisfactory.</p>

    <p class="side">In deliberate repititions.</p>

    <p>So, then, we are asking what is the condition of a man who
    has learned the dictionary standard?</p>

    <p>(1) In common talk if we speak so indistinctly as not to be
    understood, we repeat our sentence with a more careful
    articulation. As Sweet used to say, the only security against
    the decay of language through careless articulation into
    absolute unintelligibility is the personal inconvenience of
    having to repeat your words when you are indistinctly heard.
    'What' leaps out from the dictionary with a shout to the rescue
    of all his fellows. And when you have experienced this warcry
    'what? what?' oftener than you like, you will raise the
    standard of your pronunciation (just
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
       id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span> as you would raise your voice
       to a deaf listener) merely to save yourself trouble, even
       though you were insensible to the shame of the affront.</p>

    <p class="side">In asseveration.</p>

    <p>And this more careful articulation obtains also in all
    <i>asseveration</i>. A speaker who wishes to provoke attention
    to any particular statement or sentiment will speak the words
    by which he would convey it more slowly and with more careful
    articulation than the rest of his utterance.</p>

    <p>Under both these common conditions the man who has learned
    only the vernacular of Mr. Jones' phonetics has no resource but
    to emphasize with all their full horrors words like
    <i>seprit</i>, <i>sin'kerpate</i>, <i>din'ersty</i>,
    <i>ernoin't</i>, <i>mis'ernthrope</i>, <i>sym'perthy</i>,
    <i>mel'ernkerly</i>, <i>mel'erdy</i>, <i>serspe'ct</i>,
    <i>erno'y</i>, &amp;c.<a id="footnotetag24"
       name="footnotetag24"></a><a href="#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a>,
       which when spoken indistinctly in careless talk may pass
       muster, but when accurately articulated are not only vulgar
       and absurd, but often unrecognizable.</p>

    <p class="side">In public speaking.</p>

    <p>(2) Again, public speakers use a pronunciation very
    different from that in the dictionary, and Mr. Jones admits
    this and would teach it <i>sepritly</i> as 'style A'. But it is
    wrong to suppose that its characteristics are a mere fashion or
    a pedantic regard for things obsolete, or a nice rhetorical
    grace, though Mr. Jones will have it to be mostly artificial,
    'due to well-established, though perhaps somewhat arbitrary
    rules laid down by teachers of elocution'. The basis of it is
    the need of being heard and understood, together with the
    experience that style B will not answer that purpose. The main
    service, no doubt, of a teacher of elocution is to instruct in
    the management of the voice (clergyman's sore throat is a
    recognized disease of men who use their voice wrongly); but a
    right pronunciation is almost equally necessary and
    important.</p>

    <p>Now if public speakers really have to learn something
    different from their habitual pronunciation, Mr. Jones is right
    in making a separate style of it, and he is also justified in
    the degraded forms of his style B, for those are what these
    speakers have to unlearn; nor is any fault to be found with his
    diligent and admirable analysis.</p>

    <p>These two practical considerations expose the situation
    sufficiently: we may now face the triple-tongued dragon and
    exhibit how a single whiff of common sense will tumble all his
    three heads in the dust.</p>

    <p class="side">The natural right method.</p>

    <p>The insideoutness, topsy-turviness, and preposterousness of
    Mr. Jones' method is incredible. In the natural order of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span> things, children would be
       taught a careful 'high standard' articulation as a part of
       their elemental training, when in their pliant age they are
       mastering the co-ordinations which are so difficult to
       acquire later. Then when they have been educated to speak
       correctly, their variation from that full pronunciation is a
       natural carelessness, and has the grace of all natural
       behaviour, and it naturally obeys whatever laws have been
       correctly propounded by phoneticians; since it is itself the
       phenomena from which those laws are deduced. This
       carelessness or ease of speech will vary naturally <i>in all
       degrees</i> according to occasion, and being dependent on
       mood and temper will never go wrong. It is warm and alive
       with expression of character, and may pass quite
       unselfconsciously from the grace of negligence to the grace
       of correctness, for it has correctness at command, having
       learned it, and its carelessness has not been doctored and
       bandaged; and this ease of unselfconsciousness is one of the
       essentials of human intercourse: a man talking fluently does
       not consider what words he will use, he does not often
       remember exactly what words he has used, nor will he know at
       all how he pronounces them; his speech flows from him as his
       blood flows when his flesh is wounded.</p>

    <p class="side">What Mr. Jones would substitute.</p>

    <p>What would Mr. Jones' system substitute for this natural
    grace? In place of a wide scale of unconscious variation he
    provides his pupils with 'three styles', three different fixed
    grades of pronunciation,<a id="footnotetag25"
       name="footnotetag25"></a><a href="#footnote25"><sup>25</sup></a>
       which they must apply consciously as suits the occasion. At
       dinner you might be called on to talk to a bishop across the
       table in your best style B, or to an archbishop even in your
       A1, when you were talking to your neighbours in your best C.—/
       Nature would no doubt assert herself and secure a fair
       blend; but none the less, the three styles are plainly
       alternatives and to some extent mutually exclusive, whereas
       natural varieties are harmoniously interwoven and
       essentially one.</p>

    <p>Argumentative analogies are commonly chosen because they are
    specious rather than just; but there is one here which I cannot
    forbear. If a system like Mr. Jones' were adopted in teaching
    children to write, we should begin by collecting and comparing
    all the careless and hasty handwritings of the middle class and
    deduce from them the prevalent forms of the letters in that
    state of degradation. From this we should construct in our
    'style B' the alphabet which we
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"
       id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span> should contend to be the
       genuine natural product of inevitable law, and hallowed by
       'general use', and this we should give to our children to
       copy and learn, relegating the more carefully formed writing
       to a 'style A, taught by writing masters', explaining that
       its 'peculiarities' were 'modifications produced
       involuntarily as the result of writing more slowly or
       endeavouring to write more distinctly',
       &amp;c.<a id="footnotetag26"
       name="footnotetag26"></a><a href="#footnote26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

    <p>I believe that there has never been in Europe a fluent
    script so beautiful and legible as that of our very best
    English writers of to-day. But their æsthetic mastery has come
    from loving study of the forms that conscious artistry had
    perfected, and through a constant practice in their harmonious
    adaptation.</p>

    <p>Finally, it may be worth while to raise the question how it
    can be that a man of Mr. Jones' extreme competence in his
    science should commit himself to a position that appears so
    false and mischievous.</p>

    <p class="side">Reason of present discredit of phonetics.</p>

    <p>The unpopularity of phonetics is not wholly undeserved: from
    its early elements, the comfortably broad distinctions of
    convincing importance, it has progressed to a stage of almost
    infinite differentiations and subtleties; and when machinery
    was called in to dispose of controversy, a new and unsuspected
    mass of baffling detail was revealed.</p>

    <p>The subject cannot be treated parenthetically, nor am I
    capable of summarizing it; but it seems clear that the
    complexity of the science has driven off public sympathy and
    dashed the confidence of scholars, withdrawing thereby some of
    the wholesome checks that common sense might else have imposed
    on its practical exponents. The experts thus left to themselves
    in despair of any satisfactory solution, are likely enough to
    adopt the simplifications most agreeable to their present
    ideas, and measure the utility of such simplifications by the
    accidental conveniences of their own science, independently of
    other considerations.</p>

    <p class="side">The practical difficulty.</p>

    <p>The main practical difficulty which they have to meet in
    providing a reasonably satisfactory phonetic script or type for
    the English language is this, that the symbols of their
    alphabet must not greatly exceed in number those of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
       id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> literary alphabet, whereas
       the sounds that they have to indicate do greatly exceed.</p>

    <p>This discrepancy might be overcome by the use of what are
    called 'diacritical' marks, but here the universal prejudice
    against accents in English is forbidding, and it is true that
    even if printers did not rebel against them, they are yet
    distasteful and deterrent to readers out of all proportion to
    their complexity.</p>

    <p class="side">The result of Mr. Jones' solution.<br />
    <br />
    The true condition of modified vowels, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>Mr. Jones no doubt allowed himself as much liberty as he
    could venture on, but to what has this paucity and choice of
    symbols led him? It has led him to assert and teach that an
    unaccented vowel in English retains no trace of its proper
    quality<a id="footnotetag27"
       name="footnotetag27"></a><a href="#footnote27"><sup>27</sup></a>:
       that is, that you cannot, or at least do not, modify an
       unaccented vowel; you either pronounce <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>,
       <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>, distinctly, or you must substitute an
       alien sound, generally 'er', or in some consonantal
       positions a short 'i'. Thus we have <i>parersite</i>,
       <i>oblerquy</i>, <i>ikse'pt</i>, <i>ikspre'ss</i>,
       <i>iqua'ter</i>, <i>peri'sherner</i>, <i>perli'ce</i>,
       <i>spe'sherlize</i>, <i>pin'erkl</i>,
       <i>Mes'esperta'mier</i>, &amp;c., and one of his examples,
       which he advances with the confidence of complete
       satisfaction, is the name <i>Margate</i>, which he asserts
       is pronounced <i>Margit</i>,<a id="footnotetag28"
       name="footnotetag28"></a><a href="#footnote28"><sup>28</sup></a>
       that is, with a short <i>i</i>. The vowel is no doubt short,
       and its shortness is enforced by its being closed by a
       <i>t</i>: but it is not a short <i>i</i>, it is an extremely
       hastened and therefore disguised form of the original and
       proper diphthong <i>ei</i> (heard in <i>bait</i> and
       <i>gate</i>); and the true way to write it phonetically
       would be <i>ei</i>, with some diacritical sign to show that
       it was obscured. There is no long vowel or diphthong in
       English which cannot in some positions be pronounced short;
       and when hurried over between accents it is easy to see that
       there is nothing, except an obstacle of consonants, which
       can prevent the shortening of any syllable; for long and
       short are relative, and when you are speaking very slowly
       'short' sounds actually occupy as much time as 'long' sounds
       do when you are speaking quickly. You have therefore only to
       suppose a speed of utterance somewhat out of scale; and this
       is just what happens. In the second syllable of
       <i>Margate</i> the diphthong is hastened and obscured, but a
       trace <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
       id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span> of its quality remains, and
       will more distinctly appear as you speak the word slower.
       And so in the case of unaccented short vowels that are
       hurried over between the accents in talking, they are
       disguised and lose quality, but in good speakers a trace of
       the original sound will remain (as in <i>parasite</i> and
       <i>obloquy</i>), where, on the ground of indistinctness, Mr.
       Jones introduces the symbol of an <i>alien unrelated</i>
       sound, a sound, that is, which is <i>distinctly wrong
       instead of being indistinctly right</i>: and this fault
       vitiates all his books. Economy of symbols has led him to
       perversity of pronunciation.<a id="footnotetag29"
       name="footnotetag29"></a><a href="#footnote29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

    <h4>7. <i>On the claim that Southern English has to represent
    all British speech.</i></h4>

    <p>On this head certainly I can write nothing worth reading.
    Whether there is any one with so wide a knowledge of all the
    main different forms of English now spoken, their historic
    development and chief characteristics, as to be able to
    summarize the situation convincingly, I do not know. I can only
    put a few of the most evident phenomena in the relation in
    which they happen to affect my judgement.</p>

    <p>And first of all I put the small local holding which the
    Southern English dialect can claim on the map of the British
    Empire. It is plain that with such a narrow habitat it must
    show proof that it possesses very great relative superiorities
    before it can expect to be allowed even
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
       id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> a hearing: and such a claim
       must lie in its superiority in some practical or ideal
       quality: further than that it might allege that it was the
       legitimate heir of our great literature, and in possession
       of the citadel, and in command of an extensive machinery for
       its propaganda.</p>

    <p>Now, in my opinion it could not establish any one of these
    claims except the last, namely its central position and wide
    machinery.</p>

    <p>I do not pretend to foresee the future, nor even to desire
    it in any particular form; but it seems to me probable that if
    the 'P.S.P.' continues its downward course as indicated by Mr.
    Jones, then, unless everything else worsens with it, so that it
    might maintain its relative flotation in a general confusion,
    it must fall to be disesteemed and repudiated, and give place
    to one or more other dialects which, by having better preserved
    the distinctions of pronunciation, will be not only more
    convenient vehicles of intercourse, but more truthful and
    intelligible interpreters of our great literature; and I
    believe this to be well illustrated by the conditions of our
    'S.E.' homophones: and that something better should win the
    first place, I hold to be the most desirable of possible
    events. But perhaps our 'S.E.' is not yet so far committed to
    the process of decay as to be incapable of reform, and the
    machinery that we use for penetration may be used as well for
    organizing a reform and for enforcing it. There is as much
    fashion as inevitable law in our 'P.S.P.' or 'S.E.' talk, and
    if the fashion for a better, that is a more distinct and
    conservative, pronunciation should set in, then at the cost of
    a little temporary self-consciousness we might, in one
    generation, or at least in two, have things again very much as
    they were in Shakespeare's day. It is true that men are slaves
    to the naturalness of what is usual with them, and unable to
    imagine that the actual living condition of things in their own
    time is evanescent: nor do even students and scholars see that
    in the Elizabethan literature we have a perdurable gigantic
    picture which, among all stages of change, will persistently
    reassert itself, while any special characteristics of our own
    day, which seem so unalterable to us, are only a movement,
    which may no doubt be determining the next movement, but will
    leave no other trace of itself, at least no more than the
    peculiarities of the age of Queen Anne have left to us.</p>

    <p>I have been told that the German experts believe that the
    Cockney form of English will eventually prevail. This
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"
       id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span> surprising opinion may rest
       on scientific grounds, but it seems to me that Cockney
       speech will be too universally unintelligible; and, should
       it actively develop, will be so out of relation with other
       and older forms of English as to be unable to compete.</p>

    <p>I wish and hope that the subject of this section may provoke
    some expert to deal thoroughly with it. The strong feeling in
    America, in Australia, and in New Zealand, to say nothing of
    the proud dialects of our own islands, is in support of the
    common-sense view of the matter which I have here
    expressed.</p>

    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>

    <p>When I consented to write this inaugural paper, I knew that
    my first duty would be to set an example of the attitude which
    the Society had proposed to take and hopes to maintain.</p>

    <p>This Society was called into existence by the widespread
    interest in linguistic subjects which is growing on the public,
    and by the lamentable lack of any organized means for focussing
    opinion. It responds to that interest, and would supply that
    want.<a id="footnotetag30"
       name="footnotetag30"></a><a href="#footnote30"><sup>30</sup></a>
       There is no doubt that public opinion is altogether at sea
       in these matters, and its futility is betrayed and
       encouraged by the amateurish discussions and <i>obiter
       dicta</i> that are constantly appearing and reappearing in
       the newspapers. Our belief is that if facts and principles
       were clearly stated and thoroughly handled by experts, it
       would then be possible not only to utilize this impulse and
       gratify a wholesome appetite, but even to attract and
       organize a consensus of sound opinion which might influence
       and determine the practice of our best writers and
       speakers.</p>

    <p>The Society absolutely repudiates the assumption of any sort
    of Academic authority or orthodoxy; it relies merely on
    statement of fact and free expression of educated opinion to
    assure the verdict of common sense; and it may illustrate this
    method to recapitulate the various special questions that have
    arisen from following it in this particular discussion
    concerning English
    homophones.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"
       id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span> 

    <p>The main points are of course</p>

    <p>(1) The actual condition of the English language with
    respect to homophones. [This is an example of statement of
    fact.]</p>

    <p>(2) The serious nature of their inconvenience.</p>

    <p>(3) The evidence that we are unconsciously increasing
    them.</p>

    <p>(4) The consequent impoverishment of the language.</p>

    <p>From these considerations the question must arise</p>

    <p>(5) Whether it is not our duty to take steps to prevent the
    continuance and growth of this evil. [To give an example—the
    word <i>mourn</i>. If we persist in mispronouncing this word as
    <i>morn</i>, and make no distinction between <i>mourning</i>
    and <i>morning</i>, then that word will perish. We cannot
    afford to lose it: it is a good example of our best words, as
    may be seen by looking it up in the concordances to Shakespeare
    and the Bible: and what is true of this word is true of
    hundreds of others.]</p>

    <p>(6) It is pointed out that our fashionable Southern English
    dialect, our Public School Pronunciation, is one chief source
    of this damage.</p>

    <p>(7) Attention is called to the low standard of pronunciation
    adopted by our professional phoneticians, and to the falsity of
    their orthodox teaching.</p>

    <p>(8) The damage to the language which is threatened by their
    activity is exposed.</p>

    <p>(9) It is questioned how far it is possible to adopt living
    dialectal forms to save words that would otherwise perish.</p>

    <p>(10) Respect for the traditions of neglected dialects is
    advocated.</p>

    <p>(11) As to what differentiations of words should be insisted
    on [e.g. the <i>lore</i> = <i>law</i> class].</p>

    <p>(12) The necessity of observing vowel distinctions in
    unaccented syllables, [e.g. Every one now pronounces the
    <i>o</i> in the new word <i>petrol</i>, and yet almost every
    one thinks it impossible to pronounce the <i>o</i> in the old
    word <i>symbol</i>; which is absurd.]</p>

    <p>(13) The necessity for better phonetic teaching in our
    schools.</p>

    <p>(14) The quality of the new words introduced into the
    language; and the distinction between mere scientific labels,
    and those names of common new objects which must be constantly
    spoken.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
       id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span> 

    <p>(15) The claims of the Southern English dialect to general
    acceptance is questioned.</p>

    <p>(16) The general consideration that the spread of the
    English language over the world must accelerate the disuse and
    loss of the most inconvenient homophones.</p>

    <p>These matters invite expert discussion, and it is our hope
    that every such question will receive due treatment from some
    one whose knowledge qualifies him to handle it; and that when
    any principle or detail is definitely recognized as desirable,
    then the consensus of good writers and speakers will adopt it.
    This implies wide recognition, support, and co-operation; and
    though the Society has already gone far to secure this, it may
    yet seem that the small aristocracy of letters will be
    insufficient to carry through such a wide reform of habit: but
    it should be remembered that they are the very same persons
    whose example maintains the existing fashions. And, again, when
    it is urged against us that the democratic Press is too firmly
    established in its traditions to be moved by such an influence,
    it is overlooked that the great majority of those who write for
    the Press, and maintain or even create the style by which it
    holds the public ear, are men of good education, whose minds
    are thoroughly susceptible to all intellectual notions, and
    often highly sensitive to æsthetic excellence. They are all of
    them in a sense trained experts, and though working under
    tyrannous conditions are no less alive in pride and self
    respect than those who command more leisure, and they will
    readily and eagerly follow where their circumstances might
    forbid them to lead. The conviction too that they are
    honourably assisting in preserving the best traditions of our
    language will add zest to their work; while the peculiar field
    of it will provide a wholesome utilitarian test, which must be
    of good service to us by checking the affectations and
    pedantries into which it may be feared that such a society as
    the S.P.E. would conceivably lapse. Their co-operation is
    altogether desirable, and we believe attainable if it be not
    from the first assured.</p>

        <p>Homophone is a Greek word meaning 'same-sounding', and
        before using the relative word in this double way I have
        preferred to make what may seem a needless explanation. It
        is convenient, for instance, to say that <i>son</i> and
        <i>heir</i> are both homophones, meaning that each belongs
        to that particular class of words which without context are
        of ambiguous signification: and it is convenient also to
        say that <i>son</i> and <i>sun</i> and <i>heir</i> and
        <i>air</i> are homophones without explaining that it is
        meant that they are mutually homophonous, which is evident.
        A physician congratulating a friend on the birth of his
        first-born might say, 'Now that you have a son and heir,
        see that he gets enough sun and air'.</p>

        <i>rhetórical</i>, <i>rhetorícian</i>, <i>cómpany</i>,
        <i>compánion</i>, &amp;c.—we have a greater freedom in the
        use of the words. Such words, as Dr. Bradley points out,
        giving <i>Cánada</i>, <i>Canádian</i> as example, are often
        phonetic varieties due to an imported foreign syntax, and
        their pronunciation implies familiarity with literature and
        the written forms: but very often they are purely the
        result of our native syllabising, not only in displacement
        of accent (as in the first example above) but also by
        modification of the accented vowel according to its
        position in the word, the general tendency being to make
        long vowels in monosyllables and in penultimate accents,
        but short vowels in antepenultimate accents. Thus come such
        differences of sound between <i>opus</i> and <i>opera</i>,
        <i>omen</i> and <i>ominous</i>, <i>virus</i> and
        <i>virulent</i>, <i>miser</i> and <i>miserable</i>,
        <i>nation</i> and <i>national</i>, <i>patron</i> and
        <i>patronage</i>, <i>legal</i> and <i>legislate</i>,
        <i>grave</i> and <i>gravity</i>, <i>globe</i> and
        <i>globular</i>, <i>grade</i> and <i>gradual</i>,
        <i>genus</i> and <i>general</i>, <i>female</i> and
        <i>feminine</i>, <i>fable</i> and <i>fabulous</i>, &amp;c.
        In such disguising of the root-sound the main effect, as
        Dr. Bradley says, is the power to free the derivative from
        an intense meaning of the root; so that, to take his very
        forcible example, the adjective Christian, the derivative
        of Christ, has by virtue of its shortened vowel been
        enabled to carry a much looser signification than it could
        have acquired had it been phonetically indissociable from
        the intense signification of the name Christ. This freedom
        of the derivative from the root varies indefinitely in
        different words, and it very much complicates my present
        lesser statement of the literary advantage of phonetic
        variety in inflexions and derivatives.</p>

        <p>The examples above are all Latin words, and since Latin
        words came into English through different channels, these
        particular vowels can have different histories.</p>

        in some department of life or thought, then a slight

        <p>To give an example of this. In old Greek <i>we</i> and
        <i>you</i> were ημεις and υμεις: and those words became
        absolutely homophonous, so that one of them had to go. The
        first person naturally held on to its private property, and
        it invented <i>sets</i> for outsiders. Now the first step
        towards this absurdest of all homophonies, the identity of
        <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>, was no doubt the modification
        of the true full <i>u</i> to <i>ii</i>. The ultimate
        convenience of the result may in itself be applauded; but
        it is inconceivable that modern Greek should ever

        called P.S.P. (see p. <a href="#page38">38</a>); to some of

        avoid using it because it sounds to them strange or
        affected. It is difficult to <i>prove</i> that any
        particular word is in this condition, and the list is
        offered tentatively. It is made from Jones' dictionary,
        which is therefore allowed to rule whether the word is
        obsolescent rather than obsolete: some of these seem to be
        truly obsolete. Some will appear to be convincing examples
        of obsolescence, others not; but it must be remembered that
        the fact of a word being still commonly heard in some
        district or trade (though that may seem to show that it is
        in 'common use') is no evidence that it is not dying out;
        it is rather evidence that it was lately more living, which

        <p>This is a very common condition. The habitual
        pronunciation is associated in the mind with the familiar
        eye-picture of the literary printed spelling so closely
        that it is difficult for the speaker to believe that he is
        not uttering the written sounds; but he is not competent to
        judge his own speech. For instance, almost all Englishmen
        believe that the vowel which we write <i>u</i> in
        <i>but</i>, <i>ugly</i>, <i>unknown</i>, &amp;c., is really
        a <i>u</i>, like the <i>u</i> in <i>full</i>, and not a
        disguised <i>a</i>; and because the written <i>s</i> is
        sometimes voiced they cannot distinguish between <i>s</i>
        and <i>z</i>, nor without great difficulty separate among
        the plural terminations those that are spoken with an
        <i>s</i> from those that are spoken with a <i>z</i>. I was
        shocked when I first discovered my own delusions in such
        matters, and I still speak the bad Southern English that I
        learnt as a child and at school. I can hardly forgive my

        <p>The two editions of Jones' dictionary do not exactly
        correspond, e.g. in the first edition the words <i>boar</i>

        pronunciation is mentioned. But in the second edition
        <i>b[ore]</i> and <i>b[oar]</i> are allowed as variants. In
        the first edition <i>four</i>, <i>fore</i> and <i>for</i>
        are all under <i>faw</i> [fə:], and I find <i>pour</i>,
        <i>pore</i>, and <i>poor</i> all under <i>paw</i>, though
        in every case there are variants, and on p. 404 he records
        that <i>shore</i> and <i>sure</i> may be pronounced alike.
        Again, in the first edition, <i>yerr</i> [jə:] is one
        normal for <i>year</i> and also dialectal for <i>ear</i>
        (!), while in the second edition only <i>y[ear]</i> [ji:]
        is given for <i>year</i>, and <i>yerr</i> is not mentioned
        at all. As I am sure that this sort of stuff must be almost
        more tedious and annoying to read than it is to write, I
        desist from further details, but cannot resist the
        opportunity of pointing out that in their English
        pronunciation of Latin our classical teachers and
        professors have wantonly introduced this mischievous
        homophony of <i>au</i> and <i>or</i> into Latin, although
        the proper pronunciation of the 'diphthong' <i>au</i> in
        Latin is not like our <i>awe</i>, but like the <i>ou</i> of
        <i>out</i>. Thus with them <i>corda</i> and <i>cauda</i>
        are similar sounds, and the sacred <i>Sursum corda</i>
        means 'Cock your tail' just as much as it means 'Lift up
        your hearts'.</p>

        through is only a demonstration of the wrong that is done
        to it; and I would say, better leave it alone to find its
        own way, better teach it nothing at all, than worry it with
        the incomprehensible, indefensible confusion of such
        nonsense.</p>

        <p>The peril that we are in of having Mr. Jones' degraded
        pronunciation thus sprung upon us in England and taught in
        all our schools is really threatening. Indeed, as things
        are, there is little prospect of escaping from it,
        supposing the democracy should once awake to the commercial
        and spiritual advantages of teaching language phonetically:
        and that would seem to be only a question of time: the
        demand may come at any moment, and a complete machinery
        which has been skilfully prepared to meet the demand will
        offer practical conveniences to outbalance every other
        consideration.</p>

        <p>Even supposing the authorities in the Education
        Department sufficiently alive to the situation which it is
        the purpose of this section of my essay to bring to the
        fore, yet even then, were they all unanimous, they could
        not give effect to their convictions, because—</p>

        <p>They are forbidden to recommend or give preference to
        any particular book. They may not order or prohibit the use
        of any book, however good or bad they may know it to be,
        and they probably desire to avoid the suspicion of
        favouring the authors of books that have the advantage of
        national circulation.</p>

        <p>However that may be, it is a lamentable situation that
        our high-salaried Board of Education, composed of the best
        trained intelligence of the country, should not be allowed
        to exercise its discretion efficiently. The people, no
        doubt, cannot be agreed as to the principles on which they
        desire to be educated, whether political, official, or
        religious, and they deprecate official control in such
        matters. Every one objecting to some principle, they
        consent in requiring that the central authority should have
        no principle at all; but this lack of principle should not
        be extended to paralyse action in questions that demand
        expert knowledge and judgement, such as this question of
        phonetic teaching—and it shows that the public by grudging
        authority to their own officers may only fall under a worse
        tyranny, which they will suffer just because it has no
        authority.</p>

        <p>In the first edition of the Dictionary [1913] ə has only
        one interpretation, the illustration being the <i>a</i> of
        <i>about</i>. In the <i>Phonetic Transcriptions</i> [1907]
        it was the <i>er</i> of <i>over</i>, but in the new
        Dictionary [1917] ə has three interpretations with the
        following explanation: 'ə varies noticeably according to
        its position in the word and in the sentence. In final
        positions it is often replaced (<i>sic</i>) by "Λ"
        [=<i>u</i> of <i>up</i>], in other positions its quality
        varies considerably according to the nature of the
        surrounding sounds; the variations extend from almost "Λ"
        to the half-close mixed position. Three different values
        may be heard in the words <i>china</i>, <i>cathedral</i>:
        in the latter word the second "ə" has a lower and more
        retracted tongue-position than the first ə.'</p>

        <p>The value of ə when Mr. Jones first substituted it for a
        disguised unaccented vowel, was that the speaker might know
        what sound he had to produce. It was wrong, but it was
        definite. Mr. Jones would now make it less wrong by making
        it less definite. That is, in the place of something
        distinctly wrong we are offered something which has an
        offchance of being nearly right: but as it has entirely
        ousted and supplanted the original vowel I do not see how
        there is any means of interpreting it correctly. The
        <i>er</i> of <i>over</i> is a definite sound, and to print
        it where it was out of place was a definite error—to give
        it three interpretations makes it cover more ground: but
        its usurpations are still indefensible.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
